A sleek and user-friendly login authentication system built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features user registration, login validation, password strength indicators, and password reset functionality — all using client-side storage (`localStorage`) for demonstration purposes.

## How to Use

1. Open `LoginAuthenticationSystem.html` in your browser.  
2. Register a new account by clicking **Register** and filling the form.  
3. Use the registered credentials to login.  
4. Use **Forgot?** link to reset your password.  
5. Password strength is shown while typing passwords.  
6. Data is stored locally, so refreshing or closing the browser keeps data unless cleared.

## Limitations & Security Notice

> This is a front-end only demo for educational purposes.

> - No server-side validation or database integration.  
> - For real applications, always use backend authentication with hashing and secure storage.
