# 🧮 Calculator 
This is a ** Calculator Web App** that mimics the popular Casio FX-991ES PLUS. It includes functionality for basic arithmetic, trigonometric operations, logarithmic functions, powers, square roots, and constants like π — all inside a stylish and responsive interface.

> ✅ Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a custom-built expression parser (no use of `eval()`).

🧠 Behind the Scenes
This project does not rely on eval() for evaluation. Instead:

The input expression is tokenized

Then converted into RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) using the Shunting Yard Algorithm

Finally, it is evaluated step-by-step using a stack-based approach
